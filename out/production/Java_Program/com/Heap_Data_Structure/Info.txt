What is Heap?
heap is a complete binary tree that is represented by array.

NOTE - the heap should be complete binary tree, and we can't leave any space empty.

**IMPORTANT**
parent = i/2, where i is the index of child element
left child = 2 * i, where i is the index of parent node
right child = (2 * i) + 1, where i is the index of parent node

there are two types of heap:
1. MIN Heap
2. MAX Heap

MIN Heap - the root is the smallest element of tree and in each subtree child nodes are greater than root node.
MAX Heap - the root is the largest element of tree and in each subtree child nodes are smaller than root node.
